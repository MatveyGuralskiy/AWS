# Elatic Beanstalk
Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. 
Upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deploymentâ€”from capacity provisioning,
load balancing, and auto scaling to application health monitoring.

This service refers to CI/CD

You can create Infrastructure for your Web Application so fast, Elastic Beanstalk has Versioning

You also can do Green/Blue Deployment:

*Blue Deployment = Current Version of Web Application*

*Green Deployment = New version, make new Infrastructure and testing*

Platforms for Elastic Beanstalk: Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Docker(any platform can be in container)

Elastic Beanstalk controls with CloudFormation

## Deployment

I create 2 Environments for the Application "Web-Beanstalk": Production-A and Staging-B

In Production-A, I put the first version of the Application and made Deployment, after that I created new version of Application and put it to Staging-B environment

I made a Swap-Domain for to of them, so in Production we have Green/Blue Deployment of new Version
